  ## Description
  The Code Repository("EmployeeDatabase") intent is to have a EmployeeDatabase that lets the viewer see all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role and add an employee, and lastly update an employee role. Within these options one will see pertaining infos and tables show within the terminal. For example, on view all departments the user will see a formatted table showing department names, and department roles. When choosing to add a role, the user is prompted to enter a name, salary and department for the role and the role is then added to the database. The employeeDatabase also has the functionality of updating the Employee Role, which then will prompt the table to be printed with the new role for the specific person. The Manager_Ids also has a null manger that ensures when an Employee is added, you have the option to not assign the Employee a Manager. This code was written with JavaScript, NodeJS functionality and integrated SQL within the JavaScript. 

  During this project I had a few difficulties with the Add Employee functionality and the inquirer prompt. After a few days, I resolved the issues, and realized that my variable was written incorrectly which took care of one error, and a few errors followed which were resolved at that point.
